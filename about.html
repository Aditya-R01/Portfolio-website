        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Aditya Raj</strong>, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics &amp;
            Communication Engineering at <strong>Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra (BIT Mesra)</strong>, Ranchi. My academic journey
            at BIT Mesra has allowed me to delve deeply into the world of electronics, exploring both the theoretical
            and practical aspects of communication systems, embedded technologies, and circuit design. My curriculum is
            designed to provide a strong foundation in the core principles of electronics while also fostering a
            hands-on approach to solving real-world engineering problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have gained proficiency in programming and technical skills that support my
            passion for technology. I am well-versed in <strong>Machine Learning using Python</strong> and have a robust
            understanding of data-driven solutions, which I often implement through various projects and competitions.
            My skills further extend to <strong>Data Analysis with MySQL</strong>, enabling me to extract insights from
            complex datasets and support decision-making processes. Additionally, I am experienced working with
            <strong>C programming</strong>, especially in contexts where hardware-level programming and communication
            protocols are crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
            My educational background is complemented by my earlier studies at <strong>Delhi Public School</strong>,
            where I actively participated in Mathematics and Science Olympiads, nurturing my analytical and
            problem-solving abilities. These formative experiences have instilled in me a passion for continuous
            learning and a drive to tackle challenges head-on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my academic interests, I have a curiosity for historical events and enjoy exploring how technological
            advancements have shaped societies over time. This blend of technical expertise and an appreciation for
            history allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives, fostering creativity and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities at the intersection
            of technology, data, and impactful real-world applications. If you share similar interests or want to
            connect, feel free to reach out!
